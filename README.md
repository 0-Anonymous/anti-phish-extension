**Anti-Phish** is a lightweight and privacy-first browser extension designed to **detect suspicious or phishing websites** using URL heuristics, DOM inspection, and blocklist checks — all locally, without sending your browsing data anywhere.

Built using **Manifest V3**, **JavaScript**, and **secure content scripting**, this project demonstrates security engineering fundamentals, browser extension architecture, and real-world threat detection logic.
